## Before starting
**In this guide we assume that the instance we are referring to is a local one**, hence the URLs are all referring to localhost.
If that's not the case please simply replace localhost with your domain of choice.

## Join an event
In order to start voting you will need to join an open event following these steps:

1. Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200)
2. In case more than one event is open, select the one you want to join from the dropdown list at the top of the page. Note that if one event is open, you will only see the event name without any dropdown list
3. Insert your first and last name and click the **Start Session** button

**Please note that you can join and vote for an event only once.**

You will be prompted with the main voting page where you can search technologies and vote the ones that you prefer.

## Search for a specific technology
As soon as you join an event you will be prompted with a long list of technologies to choose from by scrolling them. However you may find more easy to directly search the ones that you're interested in.

That's why the voting app allows you to search for a specific technology in two ways:

1. **Search bar:** At the top of the page you can start typing the name of the technology that you are interested in and the list will be filtered automatically
2. **Quadrant filters**: Under the search bar you will find four buttons that matches the ThoughtWorks Radar quadrants names: *Tools*, *Languages & Frameworks*, *Platforms*, *Techniques*. Clicking on one of these will filter the list of technologies showing only the ones that belongs to the selected quadrant

## Vote for a technology
You can vote for **up to 10 technologies** by following these steps:

1. Click on the card with the name of the technology that you are interested in
2. A dialog will be popup showing the technology name and four buttons that matches the ThoughtWorks Radar rings names: *Adopt*, *Assess*, *Trial* and *Hold*
3. If unsure about the rings meanings you can click on the question mark icon in the top right corner of the dialog to have a quick description of them
4. Select the ring where you think the technology belongs to

Before submitting your votes you will be able to review them all by clicking on the bar at the bottom of the page
